# python-internet-speed

This small script monitors your internet speed and logs the data.
Iâ€™ve scheduled it to run automatically using Windows Task Scheduler, which is the most convenient way to use this script.

### Features
- Logs internet speeds every 2 minutes
- Saves results in `data.json`
- Calculates daily averages

## How to Run
python test.py
